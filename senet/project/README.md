This program is written using the Phaser game engine. It uses JavaScript.
The music files for this game were taken from the Sierra game Pharaoh and Cleopatra.
I do not own the rights to the game's music files. This project is for educational use only. 
This is a simple board game application. The player controls the white pieces and the goal is to move all of their pieces off the board.
