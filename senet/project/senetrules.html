The object of the game is to get all of your pieces off the board. You do so by advancing your pieces
along the blue arrow on the board. To move, click the eye to roll the sticks. To calculate your roll, add all the
white sticks together. One white stick moves 1, two white sticks moves 2, three white sticks moves 3, four white
sticks moves 4, and zero white sticks moves 5. On rolls of 1, 4, and 5, you get another turn after moving. If you
move onto a square already occupied by a black piece, you swap places with that piece. However, if the black piece
has another black piece next to it, you cannot swap with that piece. You can choose to move any of your pieces at
any time as long as the move is legal.
<br>
<br>
Once you reach the 3rd row of the board, there are special rules for advancing. From here, you must first land exactly 
on the house of beauty, which is the fifth from last square on the board, before you can advance. From here, if you 
roll a 5, you have reached the end of the board with that piece and can remove it from play. If you roll a 2, 3, or 
4, you may move ahead that many spaces. However, after that, you must roll exactly the number needed to reach the 
end of the board to remove that piece. If you have a piece in the last place on the board, you would need a 1 to get 
off the board. The same applies for the 2nd and 3rd places from last on the board. If you are in one of the last 3 
places on the board and an opponent tries to swap with you, he takes your place and you move to the house of water, 
which is the fourth from last square on the board. Now on your turn, you must roll a 4 or you get moved back to the 
ankh, which is located directly above the house of beauty. If you do roll a 4, you may remove that piece from the 
board.
<br>
<br>
If at any point you attempt an illegal move, your turn will be forfeit. If you want to pass on your turn, click on one 
of the last three spaces on the board.
